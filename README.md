Web application that allows users to create or connect existing ethereum account, check live prices and send to other with no more than a user name. 

We utilize web3.py to interact and send transactions on the ethereum blockchain. 
This utility will allows the application to send ERC20 tokens on the ethereum blockchain.

This is tailored toward the african market, however others may use it successfully.
